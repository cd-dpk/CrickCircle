# CrickCircle - A Desktop Based Game
<p align="justify">CrickCircle is a desktop game related to a popular sport of South Asia, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket">Cricket</a>. This desktop game is inspired by one of the memory of our childhood game. The game board has a circle divided into 12 sectors. Each sector is defined with a score of Cricket i.e. 6, 1, 4, wide, no ball, out, lbw etc. The area of each sector is defined dynamically. While the circle rotates with a dynamic speed, the gamer has to put a point in the circle. After circle stops rotating, the players get a score depending on the place of the point in the sectors. For example: the point falls in the ‘Six’ labeled sector after rotation, the score will be an addition of ‘Six’ with previous runs. Another example: if the point falls in the ‘Wkt’ labeled sector after rotation, the score will return a fall of ‘Wicket’. Each rotation is assumed as a ball. The aim of the players is to chase a target within predefined wickets and balls.
